## Troubleshooting

### "No renderer found" error
- Update graphics drivers
- Check OpenGL 3.3 support

### Black screen
- Check WorldEnvironment node exists
- Verify Camera3D has `current = true`

### Can't place blocks
- Make sure Build tool is selected (press 1)
- Check if mouse is over ground

### Slow performance
- Reduce block count (clear with Clear button)
- Lower graphics settings in Project Settings

---

## Customization

### Adding New Blocks
Edit `main.gd`:
```gdscript
enum BlockType {
    # ... existing blocks ...
    MY_NEW_BLOCK  # Add this
}

const BLOCK_DATA = {
    # ... existing data ...
    BlockType.MY_NEW_BLOCK: {
        "name": "My Block",
        "cat": BlockCategory.BASIC,
        "height": 1.0
    }
}
```

Then add the mesh creation in `create_block_mesh()`.

### Changing Default Colors
Edit `COLOR_PALETTE` array in `main.gd`.

### Adding New Environments
Add to `ENVIRONMENTS` dictionary in `main.gd`.
