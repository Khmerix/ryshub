## 🌐 Deployment for Schools

### Local Network (Classroom)

3. Students access via: `http://[SERVER_IP]:3000`

### Cloud Deployment

For remote learning, deploy to:
- **Heroku**: `git push heroku main`
- **Railway**: Connect GitHub repo
- **AWS/GCP**: Use EC2/Compute Engine
- **Vercel**: Not recommended (needs WebSocket support)

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

```bash
docker build -t brickforge-pro .
docker run -p 8080:8080 brickforge-pro
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **No Authentication**: Current version uses simple name-based identification
- **Room Isolation**: Each room is separate; users can't access other rooms
- **Teacher Controls**: Only teachers can create rooms, lock rooms, clear blocks
- **No Persistence**: Rooms are deleted 5 minutes after all users leave

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check firewall settings (port 8080)
- Verify all users are on the same network
- Check browser console for errors

### WebGL Not Working
- Update graphics drivers
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Port Already in Use
The default port is 3000. To use a different port:
```bash
PORT=8080 npm start  # Unix/Mac
set PORT=8080 && npm start  # Windows
```
