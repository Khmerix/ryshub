## 📚 Lesson Ideas

### History
- **Ancient Egypt:** Use Desert environment, Sandstone blocks
- **Roman Architecture:** Columns, arches on Earth
- **Mayan Temples:** Jungle environment, stone blocks

### Science
- **Solar System:** Build on different planets (Mars, Moon)
- **Gravity:** Compare builds on Earth vs Moon
- **Climate:** Build appropriate structures in Arctic vs Desert

### Engineering
- **Bridge Building:** Use I-Beams, concrete
- **Architecture:** Blueprint mode for technical drawing
- **Materials Science:** Test different block materials

### Art & Design
- **Color Theory:** Paint blocks, coordinate palettes
- **Sculpture:** Use nature blocks for organic shapes
- **Light Design:** Neon strips, light blocks for mood

## 🔒 Safety & Control

### Room Locking
- Lock the room during instruction
- Students can only watch, not build
- Unlock when ready for activity

### Clearing Room
- Removes ALL blocks permanently
- Use with caution!
- Good for fresh starts between classes

### Block Ownership
- Students can only delete their own blocks
- Teachers can delete any block
- Block owner shown on hover (future feature)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Room not found"
- Room ID may have been mistyped
- Room may have been deleted (empty for 5+ minutes)

### "Can't place blocks"
- Room may be locked by teacher
- Check if you're in the correct tool mode (T for build)

### Students can't see my blocks
- Check connection status (top right)
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure all students are in the same room

### Environment not changing
- Click the "🌍 Environment" button
- Or use number keys 1-8
- Some visual changes may be subtle
